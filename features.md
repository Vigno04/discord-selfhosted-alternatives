# Discord Alternatives Features

To clarify the definitions/meanings of the features that are included in the comparison, the below definitions are currently used:

## How Votes Are Assigned

Feature ratings use a simplified system:
- ✅ = Feature exists and works well
- 🚧 = Feature exists but may be incomplete or needs improvement
- ❌ = Feature does not yet exist

For features that use numerical ratings (like Freeness), scores are based on personal opinion after sufficient testing of the application. These ratings are subjective and may change as the project evolves.

## Github Stars

The number of stars on the primary github (or other) source code repository.

## Contributors

The number of contributors that have contributed to the project.

## Last Commit

The date of the last git commit to the project.

## Source Language

The primary language used in the repository's source code.

## License

The software license listed on the code repository.

## Demo

Does the project provide a demo instance?

## Freeness

How "free" the project is, rated on a scale of 0-10:

- **10**: Everything is completely free with no paywalls, subscriptions, or limitations. The project is truly open-source and can be self-hosted without any costs or restrictions.
- **8-9**: Mostly free but may have optional paid features or premium support offerings that don't affect core functionality.
- **6-7**: Some features may be limited or have soft paywalls, but the core functionality remains accessible.
- **4-5**: Major features are locked behind paywalls, or the license has significant limitations that restrict usage for certain use cases.
- **2-3**: Heavy reliance on paid features or subscriptions for basic functionality.
- **0-1**: Not free at all - requires payment for any meaningful use, probably will not be included in the list if the vote is so low.

- **8-9**: Very easy setup - docker-compose with minimal configuration, or simple installation script. May require basic domain setup and minimal port configuration.

- **4-5**: Complex setup - involves multiple services, extensive configuration, custom networking, or significant infrastructure requirements.
